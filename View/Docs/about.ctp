# About this plugin
## Backstory
I created superBake because I was discovering CakePHP in its version 2.1. There was no way for me 
to easily bake all my models, views and controllers with all the prefixes support, a good internationalization support
( `__d() and __()` depending on the plugin I was working on), no menu generation. So I decided to create something that can do all that,
based on a configuration file (yes, I know, Cake is powerfull *without* a configuration file...)

That's why I'm working on this. Slowly. Because it's a hobby and because development isn't my *job*.

But now, with superBake, I can generate on the fly all the skeleton of an entire app, and create small modifications in the config file that will change a lot of things in my app...
